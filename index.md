# About Me

Hi, my name is Peyman Moshfegh.
I am a **Canadian Permanent Resident** (PR) currently residing in Vancouver, British Columbia.

I obtained a Master's degree from [Sharif University of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharif_University_of_Technology) in 2016 under the supervision of [Ebadollah S. Mahmoodian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebadollah_S._Mahmoodian) (most well-known for his collaborations with fields medalist [Maryam Mirzakhani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryam_Mirzakhani)).
My thesis, [Investigating the Conditions of Graphic and Hypergraphic Sequences](http://repository.sharif.edu/resource/438918/investigating-the-conditions-of-graphic-and-hypergraphic-sequences), 
is concerned with finding necessary and sufficient conditions for a sequence to be [graphic](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GraphicSequence.html), existence of factors with predscribed degree sequences, and polynomial time algorithms for finding such factors.
I also hold a BSc from [Damghan University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damghan_University).

More broadly, I am excited about software development, object oriented programming principles and practices, and the design of efficient data structures and algorithms.
I enjoy programming in [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python), and am familiar with a variety of other languages as well.
