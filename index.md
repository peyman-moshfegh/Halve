# About Me

Hi, my name is Peyman Moshfegh.

I obtained a **Master's** degree from [Sharif University of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharif_University_of_Technology) in 2016 under the supervision of [Ebadollah S. Mahmoodian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebadollah_S._Mahmoodian) (known most famously for his collaborations with fields medalist [Maryam Mirzakhani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryam_Mirzakhani)).
My thesis, [Investigating the Conditions of Graphic and Hypergraphic Sequences](http://repository.sharif.edu/resource/438918/investigating-the-conditions-of-graphic-and-hypergraphic-sequences), 
is concerned with finding necessary and sufficient conditions for a sequence to be [graphic](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GraphicSequence.html), existence of factors with predscribed degree sequences, and *polynomial time* algorithms for finding such factors.

I am a **Canadian Permanent Resident** (PR) currently residing in Vancouver, British Columbia.
